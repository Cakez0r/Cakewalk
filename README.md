### NOTE: This project isn't in development any more and isn't a particularly good implementation! Check out my latest implementation at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2oefno9cE. Feel free to get in touch. I'm always interested to here from other game developers!

# Cakewalk

An MMO server I'm working on just for kicks. Not really intended to be a reuseable library, but the networking core should lift out pretty easily.

## Tests

Some videos of testing the server on 8th April 2012:

500 CCU in the same area: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFrUcVLXdRM
3000 CCU spread across 25 zones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKnmbVt6DQM
